<h>Welcome to the Photoshop Scripting Cookbook!</h>

<p class="lead">This website's intent is to collect and share commented code snippets coming from the <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/photoshop/photoshop_scripting">Adobe Photoshop Scripting</a> and the independent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150314191545/http://ps-scripts.com/">ps-scripts.com</a> forums.</p>

        Founded in 2005, ps-scripts.com has been maintained by Mike Hale, who <a href="http://www.charlestonfunerals.com/memsol.cgi?user_id=1398164">passed away in late 2014</a>. The forum's archive is an invaluable source of information: discussions, snippets, recipes. To date, the original domain is no more active due to Mike's passing, but it is still available as a snapshot (dated May 2015) in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150314191545/http://ps-scripts.com/">Archive.org website</a>.<br>This collection is also a tribute to Mike's legacy, trying to preserve and make the most of his and all the forum's excellent contributors work over the years.
